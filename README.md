### Basic how-to guides on data science-ing^* with Python.

Every iPython notebook has been commented on and provides easy-to-follow walkthroughs on basic data science concepts. Please send me a message if you see any errors or you have the burning need to tell me where I could be working far more efficiently than I am. Seriously. Please tell me!

^* Technical term, obviously.
